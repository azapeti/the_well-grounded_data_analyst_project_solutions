# The Well-Grounded Data Analyst - Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from *The Well-Grounded Data Analyst* by David Asboth. The exercises involve working with real or realistic datasets that data analysts commonly encounter in professional settings outside of training courses.

## Structure
Each chapter's exercises are organized in separate folders, with solutions provided in the form of scripts, notebooks, or other relevant files. The datasets used are either provided by the book or sourced to reflect practical data analysis scenarios.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to share my approach to solving the book's exercises, showcasing practical data analysis techniques and problem-solving strategies.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the solutions, use them as a reference, or adapt them for your own learning. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., Python, R, or specific libraries) as noted in each chapter's folder.
